# Unofficial template for [Spring engine](https://github.com/spring/spring/) (WIP)

## WARNING: this repository contains misleading information and might contain outdated information

### Please, read https://springrts.com/wiki/Lua:Environments and https://springrts.com/wiki/Gamedev:Main first

You might find more useful information on Spring's [wiki](https://springrts.com/wiki/Gamedev:Main) and on Spring's [forum](https://springrts.com/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=14) and [here](https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/spring/articles).\
Nonetheless, I didn't understand some ambiguity on the wiki and I didn't check stuff throughly yet etc, but I'm trying to fix some mistakes.

(Some stuff should be implemented as VS code extensions etc. to support Spring's API properly)
